# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This directory centralizes guidance for planning, executing, and continuously improving projects at OctoAcme. These process docs are intended to accelerate onboarding, reduce single-person dependencies, and provide a single source of truth for how we run projects.

## Overview of Project Management Processes
OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first approach with clear roles and measurable outcomes. Projects progress through a lifecycle of Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective. Work is broken into small, testable increments, tracked on a project board, and validated by both automated and manual quality checks. Communication cadence and escalation paths are defined so teams can surface and resolve risks quickly.

Key elements:
- Roles: Project Manager (delivery and communications), Product Manager (outcomes and prioritization), Developers (implementation), QA (validation), and Stakeholders (input and approvals).
- Workflows: Backlog grooming, sprint planning, daily standups, pull request reviews, CI-driven testing and security scans, demos, and retrospectives.
- Quality & Risk: Unit/integration tests, smoke/end-to-end checks for critical flows, a lightweight risk register with owners and mitigations, and formal release checklists and rollback plans.
- Communication: Weekly PM/PdM syncs, regular stakeholder updates, and incident/triage templates to ensure timely, blameless communication.
